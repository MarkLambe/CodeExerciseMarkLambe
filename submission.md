Hello HubSpot developers!

This is a Vue JS project. I've been using Vue a lot more than React in my currrent role, so it's more
fresh in my mind, and I thought it best to use that.

It uses Vuex to maintain a store for our data.
I've used a [small third-party directive](https://github.com/vue-bulma/click-outside) to handle click-outside for the dropdowns.
I've used [Fuse](https://fusejs.io/) for the fuzzy search.

If there's any questions just let me know. As requrested once npm and node are installed `npm i` and `npm run dev` will get
everything going.

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

-> My custom multi-select isn't very accessible and I think would cause problems with screen-readers, etc. That would have
to be fixed up before it could be used in production. I was going to choose a third-party one to avoid this problem,
but thought it best to show that I could do it too ☺️

-> I wouldn't use Google material icons, but they suited here for the magnifying glass.

-> One image 404s, I'd have liked to have a nicer solution for handling that.

-> Generally it could use a few more touches to look a bit clearer.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I think I got everything.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

It was a fun test :)
